// // i ) Make a state class in which you declare the variable that is going to be changed . and then make the const constructor of that specific state class .
// // Make all of the possible states .
// // Like in case of counter the new and the previous value both are int and there is no change so we we only use the int here .
// // In the case of the api we have a lot of states like initial state , Loading state , loaded state , error state etc .
// // So we have to declare all of them here .

// class CounterState {
//   final int counter;
//   const CounterState({required this.counter});
// }
